# Blockchain

This project will involve fetching blockchain data, analyzing transactions, and visualizing the results.

The example here uses the Web3.py library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and Matplotlib for visualizing the data. You can modify the code to fit the specific blockchain and expand its functionality as needed.

Project: Blockchain Transaction Analytics in Python
This project will:

1. Fetch Ethereum transaction data (or any EVM-based blockchain).
2. Analyze transaction patterns, gas usage, and wallet balances.
3. Visualize these patterns using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas

Requirements can be installed using - pip install web3 matplotlib pandas requests
